# Project Summary

**Project Title:** Basic Sentiment Analysis

**Project Description:** This project conducts a basic sentiment analysis on a conversation between US President Trump and Ukraine President Zelensky.

**Problem Description**
**Objective:** Analyze the sentiment expressed in the conversation and classify it as positive, negative, or neutral.

**Project Goals**
Analyze sentiment polarity and subjectivity in the conversation.
Classify the sentiment of each statement as positive, negative, or neutral.
Visualize the sentiment distribution in the conversation.
Provide insights into the overall sentiment tone of the conversation.
## Data Analysis Summary
**Data Source:** The conversation data is sourced from a CSV file containing text and sentiment analysis results.

**Data Cleaning:** The text data undergoes preprocessing steps such as lowercase conversion, punctuation removal, and stop word removal.

**Sentiment Analysis:** Sentiment polarity and subjectivity are calculated using the TextBlob library.

**Visualization:** Word clouds are generated to visualize frequently occurring words. Additionally, sentiment distribution is visualized using histograms.

**Analysis Summary:** Based on the provided dialogue between President Trump and President Zelenski, it appears that the overall sentiment is predominantly positive. Both leaders express gratitude and pleasantries throughout the conversation. President Trump acknowledges Ukraine's progress and expresses optimism about its future, while President Zelenski appreciates the support from the United States and European countries. The discussion covers various topics, including anti-corruption efforts, economic cooperation, military aid, and diplomatic relations.

However, there are moments of neutrality and slight negativity, particularly when discussing issues like corruption, investigations, and political opponents. President Trump's remarks regarding investigations into the Bidens and Hillary Clinton's emails introduce some negative sentiment, but these are relatively minor aspects of the conversation.

Overall, the tone remains largely positive, with both leaders emphasizing cooperation and mutual support between the United States and Ukraine. Therefore, the conclusion drawn from these results is that the dialogue reflects a generally positive and diplomatic interaction between the two presidents.
